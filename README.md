# TreeMap-Implementation
**BalancedMap**: Implementing a Map ADT using composition with java.util.TreeMap

**UnbalancedMap**: Implementing a Map ADT directly from scratch. The Map ADT is implemented with an unbalanced binary search tree, following its convention of placing small items in the left-subtree and larger items in the right-subtree. A private, inner-inner class is created to represent the map's node objects.

The Map ADT is able to perform the following functionalities:
- Indicates if the map contains an object
- Adds the key/value pair to the map
- Deletes the key/value pair
- Retrieves the value associated with the provided key
- Retrieves the key(s) associated with the provided value
- Indicates the size of the map (count of key/value entries)
- Indicates if the map is empty
- Clears the map and returns it to an empty state
- Retrieves all key entries in the map
- Retrieves all value entries in the map
